This data is from Kaggle found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/blurredmachine/are-your-employees-burning-out). The goal of this project was to see if we can find what variables affect employee burnout. After determining what variables are meaningful we need to see if we can build a model to accurately predict employee burn rate.
